## Description


This project we are going to make LoRa comunication between 2 devieces. in both circuits we are going to have an esp 32, the esp32 is a micro controller wich is powered by a 3.3v continuous current.

LoRa is a wireless data communication technology that uses a radio modulation technique that can be generated by Semtech LoRa transceiver chips

the transmitter will send the temperature and humidity measured by a dht22 seansor

## How to use the code

> There are 2 programs: Receiver and Tresmitter. 
> So the code has to be built and run on two differet instances

Running with VSCode: 

* Clone the github repositor 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Rick-1242/LoRaDHT22.git
```
* Go to your bash terminal, and change your current directory by the repository folder
* After that, we can build this code. So, type in a bash terminal the :
```sh
platformio run
```
* If you want to test what happens if we program our board, type:
```sh
platformio run --target upload
```
* Finally, to show the message from the board, and confirm all steps are done well type the following:
```sh
platformio device monitor --port COM[3]
```
* In this case, PC and board are connected through COM3 port, but be careful and check it.

* Procced to compile and load the code


  

Alternatively you can run the project with the `Arduino IDE`:
* Clone the github repository
* Go to the `./LoRaDHT22/<<Reciver || Trasmitter>>/src` folder and open the `main.cpp` file with the IDE
* To install the ESP32 board in your Arduino IDE, follow these instructions:
  
    1. In your Arduino IDE, go to `File>Preferences`
    2. Enter the following into the “Additional Board Manager URLs” field: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json`
    3. Then, click the “OK” button     
    4. Open the Boards Manager. Go to `Tools>Board>Boards Manager…`
    5. Search for `ESP32` and press install button for the “ESP32 by Espressif Systems“:
    6. Select your Board in `Tools>Board` menu (in our case it’s the DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1)
    7. Select the correct COM Port
* Procced to compile and load the code
