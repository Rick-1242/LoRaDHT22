***

This project we are going to make LoRa comunication between 2 devieces. in both circuits we are going to have an esp 32, the esp32 is a micro controller wich is powered by a 3.3v continuous current.

LoRa is a wireless data communication technology that uses a radio modulation technique that can be generated by Semtech LoRa transceiver chips

the transmitter will send the temperature and humidity measured by a dht22 seansor
